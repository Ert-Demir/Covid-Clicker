Covid Defender is a click-defender game where you play as a white blood cell inside a vessel fighting against the coronaviruses that are trying to invade the body. 
Your mission is to kill as many viruses as possible and defend the body from the virus attack.

How to Play
1. To start the game, simply click on the "Start" button.
2. Use your mouse to move the white blood cell fighter to the right side of the screen where the viruses are coming from.
3. Click on the viruses to kill them before they reach the right side of the screen.
4. With each virus you kill, you earn points. Use these points to buy upgrades for your white blood cell fighter.
5. If a virus reaches the right side of the screen, you lose immune points. Once your immune points reach zero, the game is over.
6. You can pause or resume the game at any time by clicking on the "Pause/Resume" button.
